### How do we get information ✍️(◔◡◔)

> [Discord Bot](https://namedc.org/invite) 🤖
> - our discord bot is running and waiting for events like userUpdate and such, once it sees one it adds the user who triggered the event to our database.


> Looking up a user ID 🔎
> - When you lookup a user ID our database automatically adds the username to our database
