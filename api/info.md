### How does it work?

> You basically buy a key from our [autobuy](https://namedc.org/purchase) and get a key delivered to your email.
> <br>After that you redeem it [here](https://namedc.org/redeem) and you get a token with the queries that you bought.
> <br>Then you can proceed to the next page.

### Rate limits

> Each account will have a rate limit of 100 requests per minute.

> Please note that if you exceed over the rate limit or try to bypass it you will be immediately blacklisted from our service.

> Our rate limit is 60 seconds.
